**PyLite: A Java-Based Python Interpreter**

---

### **Overview**

PyLite is a Java-based project that implements a simple interpreter and compiler for a subset of the Python programming language. The compiler translates source code written in this Python subset into bytecode instructions, which can then be executed by the interpreter. This project is designed to provide a foundational framework for understanding the basics of interpreters, compilers, and bytecode execution.

---

### **Key Features**

- Currently supports basic arithmetic operations:
  - Addition (`+`)
  - Subtraction (`-`)
  - Exponentiation (`**`)
- Supports simple boolean expressions and operations.

---

### **Project Components**

1. **Lexer**: Tokenizes the source code into a sequence of tokens for further processing.
2. **Parser**: Parses the tokenized source code into an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST).
3. **Compiler**: Transforms the AST into bytecode instructions.
4. **Interpreter**: Executes the generated bytecode instructions.

---

### **Usage Instructions**

#### **Compilation**
1. Ensure that Java is installed and properly configured on your system.
2. Compile the source code using the Java compiler:
   ```bash
   javac *.java
   ```

#### **Execution**
1. Run the compiled `Main` class, providing your Python code as an argument:
   ```bash
   java Main "<python code>"
   ```
2. The compiler will process the input code by tokenizing, parsing, compiling, and executing it. The generated bytecode instructions will be printed to the console.

---

### **Sample Usage**

Given the following Python subset code:
```python
(2 + 3) - (2 - 4) - 6
```
You can compile and execute it as follows:

```bash
java Main "(2 + 3) - (2 - 4) - 6"
```

**Expected Output:**
The console will display the processed bytecode and the result of the computation. For instance:
```
Bytecode:
LOAD_CONST 2
LOAD_CONST 3
BINARY_ADD
LOAD_CONST 2
LOAD_CONST 4
BINARY_SUBTRACT
BINARY_SUBTRACT
LOAD_CONST 6
BINARY_SUBTRACT
Result: 1
```

### **Future Enhancements**

The following features are planned for future development:

- [ ] Fix errors related to conditional statement support (`if` clauses).
- [ ] Resolve issues with variable assignments.
- [ ] Add support for comparison operators: `==`, `!=`, `<`, `<=`, `>`, `>=`.
- [ ] Enhance support for complex boolean expressions.
- [ ] Implement chained comparisons (e.g., `1 < x <= 10`).
- [ ] Introduce support for `elif` and `else` statements.
- [ ] Add support for conditional (ternary) expressions.
- [ ] Implement `while` loops.
- [ ] Add support for `break` and `continue` statements.
